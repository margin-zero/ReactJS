The GAME of FIFTEEN

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

* Sources for building by react-scripts: ./src and ./public
* Run from terminal: npm run build
* App will build into ./build folder.

If you prefer to, you can build using Webpack. 
* Sources for Webpack: ./src and ./app
* Run from terminal: npm run wbuild
* App will build into ./dist folder

Both builds are configured to run application from current folder so just hit index.html and play - even from local file system.
